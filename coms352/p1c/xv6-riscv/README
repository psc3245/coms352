### Updates: 

#### Added Two New Schdeulers:

##### 1. Round-Robin with Strict Priorities (RRSP)

- A simple priority scheduler that adheres to the following rules:

	- Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), process A runs and process B does not.

	- Rule 2: If Priority(A) == Priority(B), processes A and B run in a standard round-robin fashion.

	- Rule 3: Priority is calculated from the process's nice value: Priority = 20 - nice.

This scheduler uses strict priority to force all low priority processes to wait until all high priority processes are finished or not runnable.

#### 2. Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

- A more complex scheduler that implements a system of three priority queues (Q2, Q1, Q0) to favor I/O-bound processes and prevent starvation.

	- Queues:

		- Q2 (Highest): nice <= -10, Quantum = 1 tick

		- Q1 (Middle): -10 < nice <= 10, Quantum = 10 ticks (Default queue)

		- Q0 (Lowest): nice > 10, Quantum = 15 ticks

	- Rules:

		- Strict Priority: Q2 processes run before Q1; Q1 runs before Q0.

		- Round-Robin: Processes on the same queue level run in round-robin.

		- Starting Queue: New processes are assigned a queue based on their nice value.

		- Demotion: If a process uses its entire time quantum (timer interrupt while on CPU), it is demoted to the next lower queue.

		- Priority Boost: Every 60 ticks, all processes in the system are moved back to their original starting queues.

		- Nice Change: If nice() is called, the process is immediately moved to the correct starting queue for its new nice value.

#### How to Select a Scheduler

To change the active scheduler, edit the SCHEDULER macro in kernel/param.h:

##### kernel/param.h

// Create a definition for each of the scheduler choices
#define SCHED_RR		0
#define SCHED_RRSP		1
#define SCHED_MLFQ		2
// Choose which scheduling algorithm we will actually use
#define SCHEDULER		SCHED_RRSP // <-- CHANGE THIS VALUE

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
