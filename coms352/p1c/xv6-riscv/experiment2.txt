Experiment 2 is nicetest.c, which creates four processes.

Two processes are given nice values of 15 and two are given nice values of -15.

Expected Behavior for each Scheduler:

RR:
- Ignores nice values. All processes share time equally.

RRSP:
- The two processes with higher priority (nice of -15) will dominate the CPU.
- Since all processes are always runnable, the only thing that matters is priority.
- The high priority processes (nice of -15) will finish first and then the low priority processes (nice of 15) will finish second.

MLFQ:
- Nice values of 15 and -15 puts these processes at queue 0 and queue 2 respectively.
- The Q2 processes will run first, then be demoted to Q1, run again, then be demoted to Q0.
- Once all processes are in Q0, it will be round robin.
