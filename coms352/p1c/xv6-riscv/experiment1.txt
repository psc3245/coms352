Experiment 1 is fairtest.c and creates four processes.

This experiment seeks to show how each scheduler will run processes with equal priority.

All four processes created are with default nice value of 0.

RR:
- All processes share time equally. 

RRSP:
- Since all processes have the same nice value, the processes will share time equally.

MLFQ:
- All processes will start in Q1 due to their nice value. 
- The processes will run in Q1, then be demoted to Q0.
- After all processes are in Q0, they will run in round robin.
